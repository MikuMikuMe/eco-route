# eco-route

Creating an "eco-route" planner requires integrating data from various sources such as real-time traffic data and terrain conditions. This example will demonstrate a simplified version of such a program using Python. Note that a fully functional application would typically require access to APIs providing real-time data, such as Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, and possibly some machine learning capabilities to optimize the routes effectively.

Below is the structured example program with comments and basic error handling:

```python
import requests
import json
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Constants for API keys and endpoints
# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with actual API keys
TRAFFIC_API_KEY = 'YOUR_TRAFFIC_API_KEY'
TERRAIN_API_KEY = 'YOUR_TERRAIN_API_KEY'
TRAFFIC_API_URL = 'https://api.trafficdata.com/v1/current?'
TERRAIN_API_URL = 'https://api.terraindata.com/v1/elevation?'

def fetch_traffic_data(start, end):
    """
    Fetch traffic data between two geographical points.
    """
    try:
        response = requests.get(
            TRAFFIC_API_URL,
            params={'start': start, 'end': end, 'key': TRAFFIC_API_KEY})
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        logging.info("Traffic data fetched successfully.")
        return data
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        logging.error(f"HTTP Error: {errh}")
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        logging.error(f"Error Connecting: {errc}")
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        logging.error(f"Timeout Error: {errt}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        logging.error(f"API Request Error: {err}")
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logging.error("There was an error parsing the JSON data.")
    return None

def fetch_terrain_data(route):
    """
    Fetch terrain data for a given route.
    """
    try:
        response = requests.get(
            TERRAIN_API_URL,
            params={'route': route, 'key': TERRAIN_API_KEY})
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        logging.info("Terrain data fetched successfully.")
        return data
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        logging.error(f"HTTP Error: {errh}")
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        logging.error(f"Error Connecting: {errc}")
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        logging.error(f"Timeout Error: {errt}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        logging.error(f"API Request Error: {err}")
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logging.error("There was an error parsing the JSON data.")
    return None

def calculate_eco_route(start, end):
    """
    Calculate the eco-friendly route considering traffic and terrain data.
    """
    traffic_data = fetch_traffic_data(start, end)
    if traffic_data is None:
        logging.error("No traffic data available, cannot calculate eco-route.")
        return None
    
    # Assume the route is derived from traffic data here
    route = traffic_data.get("route", [])
    
    if not route:
        logging.error("No valid route found in traffic data.")
        return None

    terrain_data = fetch_terrain_data(route)

        logging.error("No terrain data available, cannot optimize the route for eco-friendliness.")
        return None
    
    # Mock logic to determine the best eco-route
    # In real scenarios, additional logic such as analyzing elevation changes would be applied.
    optimized_route = route  # Placeholder: replace with real optimization logic
  
    return optimized_route

def main():
    start_location = "START_COORDINATES"  # Example: "37.7749,-122.4194"
    end_location = "END_COORDINATES"      # Example: "34.0522,-118.2437"
  
    logging.info("Starting eco-route calculation.")
    eco_route = calculate_eco_route(start_location, end_location)
  
    if eco_route:
        logging.info("Eco-route calculated successfully.")
        # Print or process the eco-route further
        print("Optimal eco-route:", eco_route)
    else:
        logging.error("Failed to calculate an eco-friendly route.")

### Key Considerations:
- **API Integration**: Replace `YOUR_TRAFFIC_API_KEY` and `YOUR_TERRAIN_API_KEY` with valid API keys. Also, replace URLs with appropriate ones if you're integrating actual services.
- **Error Handling**: The code handles common HTTP errors and JSON parsing errors.
- **Route Calculation**: In a real-world application, you'd need advanced algorithms (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s or A* algorithm) and possibly machine learning models to optimize routes based on input data.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure any handling of geo-data complies with privacy and data protection regulations.
  
This simplified program demonstrates key concepts but should be extended further for production use, including real API endpoints, complex optimization logic, and more robust error handling.
